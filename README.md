# Java-Assignment-010 - Classes and Objects

## Part 1 - Analyze
* Add Comments to the Code below and label the following using comments:
  1. Class name
  2. All **instance variables/fields** and their data-types
  3. The **Constructor** and the **Constructor Parameters**
  4. Where a **Student** object gets created.
  5. Where the **instance variables** value gets set and what its values are.
  6. All the instance methods for the class **Student**

```java
class Student{  //class name
    private String name;
    private int rollNo;
   
    Student(String s, int r) //constructor w/ parameter string s and int r
    {
   	    name = s; //name is assigned to the variable s
   	    rollNo = r; //rollNo is assigned to the variable r
    }
   
    void methodForDisplay()// method
    {
        System.out.println(name+"'s Roll No: "+rollNo);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student obj1=new Student("Rambo",21); //new Student object is created
        obj1.methodForDisplay();//calls for methodForDisplay method
    }
}
```

## Part 2 - Public VS Static

* Read the W3Schools page on class methods: [W3Schools Java Class Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_class_methods.asp)
* In your own words, write a few sentences below explaining the difference between static and public methods in relation to a class.
- In java the static method is particularly useful because it's easy to access later in the program, whereas the public method is more difficult to access without something else in the program . The difference between static and public is that the static method can be used without already having an object in the code and the public method is only useful for existing objects.

## Part 3 - Dogs

* View the image below, and from the image, construct a Java file **Dog** that mirrors the diagrammed class and the 3 dog objects.
![Dog Class](images/ClassVSObject.png)

* Your class should be named **Dog**
* You should have **private** instance variables/fields for all the data members.
* You should have a **constructor** that sets the initial state of the data members via passed parameters.
    * Think about what data-types the fields and parameters will need!!!
* You should have 4 instance methods for eat, run, sleep, and name
* You should have a **main** method that creates the 3 Dog objects in the diagram.
* Make at least 2 of your methods functional (i.e. perform some action)!!!
    * For Example: method eat might take a class parameter named **Food** (i.e. another class) that has a field **weight**, and your eat method might reduce the weight in **Food**.

## Part 4 - Turn-In

* Create a feature branch Feature1
* Commit your code and push it back to your account.
* Create a Pull request as you have been doing for all assignments.
* Paste the Pull request URL back into the Canvass assignment page for credit.
